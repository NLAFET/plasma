# PLASMA example make.inc, using Intel MKL and gcc

# PLASMA is a software package provided by:

CC        = gcc
FC        = gfortran
AR        = ar
RANLIB    = ranlib


# --------------------
# flags

# Use -fPIC to make shared (.so) and static (.a) libraries;
# can be commented out if making only static libraries.
FPIC      = -fPIC

CFLAGS    = -fopenmp $(FPIC) -O3 -std=c99   -Wall -pedantic -Wshadow -Wno-unused-function

# usually generic is fine
lua_platform = linux

# --------------------
# PLASMA is a library in C, but can be also used from Fortran. 
# In this case, Fortran interface needs to be build.
# 0 = no  - Fortran codes will not be touched, the FC and FCFLAGS variables 
#           will not be referenced
# 1 = yes - Fortran interface will be compiled and included into the library 

fortran ?= 1

# --------------------
# libraries
# This assumes $MKLROOT is set in your environment.
# Add these to your .cshrc or .bashrc, adjusting for where MKL is installed:
# in .cshrc:   source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.csh intel64
# in .bashrc:  source /opt/intel/bin/compilervars.sh  intel64

# With gcc OpenMP (libgomp), use -lmkl_sequential or (-lmkl_gnu_thread   with MKL_NUM_THREADS=1).
# With icc OpenMP (liomp5),  use -lmkl_sequential or (-lmkl_intel_thread with MKL_NUM_THREADS=1).
LIBS      = -L$(MKLROOT)/lib -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core -lm -ldl

INC       = -I$(MKLROOT)/include
