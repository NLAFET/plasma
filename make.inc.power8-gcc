# Use -fPIC to make shared (.so) and static (.a) libraries;
# can be commented out if making only static libraries.

# --------------------
# PLASMA is a library in C, but can be also used from Fortran. 
# In this case, Fortran interface needs to be build.
# 0 = no  - Fortran codes will not be touched, the FC and FCFLAGS variables 
#           will not be referenced
# 1 = yes - Fortran interface will be compiled and included into the library 

fortran ?= 0

# --------------------
# libraries

# USE NETLIB LAPACK distributed LAPACKE,CBLAS and its headers. 
# Link with ESSL for most of its BLAS/LAPACK functions
# Link with Netlib LAPACK/BLAS for the missing functions in ESSL.
